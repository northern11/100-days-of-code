# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January, 21 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Creating a tribute page and doing a brush up on coding

**Thoughts:** Today I'm starting 100 days of code to build a better habit of coding. I started doing the p1xt 3.0 Job Ready guide as I had already done some of the 2.0 guide. I was doing Tier 1 for the basics and refresher to get into it, but that may be too basic.

**Link to work:** Not available yet as I am going to figure out surge.sh hosting tomorrow!

### Day 1: January, 22 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added some quotes to the tribute page and the CSS reset

**Thoughts**: It's hard to push everything into an hour when your browser is not responding. However I put some content on the page and got it hosted on surge: success! Tomorrow more content and styling.

### Day 2: January, 24 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added some content to the tribute page and the CSS styling. I missed a day already...

**Thoughts**: I thought it would be easy to have content to put on the page in a timeline format like the freecodecamp [example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx), but my Tribute subject doesn't have much of timeline. So far the hardest part as been coming up with a layout for the page and content. Most of the historical info I have is in story form and not time stamped too much. I thought maybe of making a cool CSS background of the Brooks Range and making it interactive, but I still need to create the content first.

### Day 3: January, 25 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added some more content to the tribute page and the CSS styling. I also started integrating Flexbox.

**Thoughts**: This is a late post as I didn't make time to post yesterday, but did work on the tribute page. I incorporated more CSS styling this time and got to play around with CSS Flexbox. It definitely made it easier to center content. I still have to figure out how to display the information about my tribute and to include more information as well. Things are starting to come together though with the tribute page.

### Day 4: January, 26 2019

**Today's Progress**: I only added more content and did some learning on CSS Grid, which I may want to use instead of Flexbox for some things on this page

**Thoughts**: Today I really only added content and I'm still figuring out how I'm going to style it. Even though it passes the FCC tests I am not satisified with how it looks. Tomorrow I will dress up the lists with a title and put them in column form.

### Day 5: January, 27 2019

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about CSS Grid today from FCC and implemented it in my tribute info on my site.

**Thoughts**: Today I styled my content with Grid, but the text is still not responsive and the page still doesn't pop so I'll attack that again tomorrow.

### Day 6: January, 29 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have learned more about responsive viewport units and using them has helped make my typography more responsive.

**Thoughts**: Today I styled my content with responsive viewport units. The text is responsive, but now it isn't always centered like it should be. Also when I view my page in landscape mode it doesn't expand to fit the page. At the moment I'm stumped on how to fix this.

## Day 7: January, 31 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent time learning about forms and their attributes. 

**Thoughts**: I didn't think forms would be so complicated, and I got most of the content I wanted I just need to style it

## Day 8: February, 1 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent more time learning about forms and their attributes. 

**Thoughts**: I didn't think forms would be so complicated, I still need to style it more. i thought using flexbox would make it easier.

## Day 9: February, 2 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent more time trying to style my survey form.

**Thoughts**: I didn't realize you could style a form with an unordered list and I found some ideas [here](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/building-responsive-forms-with-flexbox--cms-26767) that I still need to finish implementing tomorrow. At the  moment I'm trying to get my form to look like the [Free Code Camp one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP) and I'm not sure if using an unordered list is the best way, but I'm going to try it out more tomorrow.

## Day 10: February, 3 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent more time trying to style my survey form.

**Thoughts**: I thought styling my form would be easier, but I'm having trouble moving flex items around. I need to get the labels on the left and the inputs/checkboxes/dropdowns on the right. At the moment it is just trial and error and I need to work on targeting items individually. The plan still trying to get my form to look like the [Free Code Camp one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP).

## Day 11: February, 4 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent more time trying to style my survey form.

**Thoughts**: I didn't think it wouldn't take as much time to style my form properly, but it has been difficult to wrap my head aroudn this. Today I learned that margin is key to centering or moving things where you want because you cannot justify-self with flex, there is only align-self.  I just have to figure out how to move checkboxes/buttons and their labels together and get it aligned. The plan still trying to get my form to look like the [Free Code Camp one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP).

## Day 12: February, 5 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent EVEN more time trying to style my survey form...

**Thoughts**: Today I messed around with the margins on my buttons and checkboxes and got the alignment correct, however this breaks responsiveness and I will have to create more breakpoints to make it look good on other devices.  At this point I am considering scraping the flexbox stuff and going back to floats and margins. I will spend one more day fussing around and the most likely scrap. The plan still trying to get my form alignment to look somewhat like the [Free Code Camp one](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP).

## Day 13: February, 7 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent time finishing my survey form and checking it against useablity and speed.

**Thoughts**: I finally finished my survey form and it feels good to be done. The CSS probably needs to be redone as I feel like I hacked it up, but I am going to take a break and move on from this for now. For speed tests I'm using [Page Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), for Web Accessibilty I'm use [WAVE](http://wave.webaim.org/), and I used an [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) on the CSS. I'm going to keep this process for future projects.
