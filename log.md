# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January, 21 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Creating a tribute page and doing a brush up on coding

**Thoughts:** Today I'm starting 100 days of code to build a better habit of coding. I started doing the p1xt 3.0 Job Ready guide as I had already done some of the 2.0 guide. I was doing Tier 1 for the basics and refresher to get into it, but that may be too basic.

**Link to work:** Not available yet as I am going to figure out surge.sh hosting tomorrow!

### Day 1: January, 22 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added some quotes to the tribute page and the CSS reset

**Thoughts**: It's hard to push everything into an hour when your browser is not responding. However I put some content on the page and got it hosted on surge: success! Tomorrow more content and styling.

### Day 2: January, 24 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added some content to the tribute page and the CSS styling. I missed a day already...

**Thoughts**: I thought it would be easy to have content to put on the page in a timeline format like the freecodecamp [example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx), but my Tribute subject doesn't have much of timeline. So far the hardest part as been coming up with a layout for the page and content. Most of the historical info I have is in story form and not time stamped too much. I thought maybe of making a cool CSS background of the Brooks Range and making it interactive, but I still need to create the content first.

### Day 3: January, 25 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added some more content to the tribute page and the CSS styling. I also started integrating Flexbox.

**Thoughts**: This is a late post as I didn't make time to post yesterday, but did work on the tribute page. I incorporated more CSS styling this time and got to play around with CSS Flexbox. It definitely made it easier to center content. I still have to figure out how to display the information about my tribute and to include more information as well. Things are starting to come together though with the tribute page.

### Day 4: January, 26 2019

**Today's Progress**: I only added more content and did some learning on CSS Grid, which I may want to use instead of Flexbox for some things on this page

**Thoughts**: Today I really only added content and I'm still figuring out how I'm going to style it. Even though it passes the FCC tests I am not satisified with how it looks. Tomorrow I will dress up the lists with a title and put them in column form.

### Day 5: January, 27 2019

**Today's Progress**: I learned more about CSS Grid today from FCC and implemented it in my tribute info on my site.

**Thoughts**: Today I styled my content with Grid, but the text is still not responsive and the page still doesn't pop so I'll attack that again tomorrow.

### Day 6: January, 29 2019

**Today's Progress**: I have learned more about responsive viewport units and using them has helped make my typography more responsive.

**Thoughts**: Today I styled my content with responsive viewport units. The text is responsive, but now it isn't always centered like it should be. Also when I view my page in landscape mode it doesn't expand to fit the page. At the moment I'm stumped on how to fix this.
