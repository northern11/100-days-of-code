# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January, 21 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Creating a tribute page and doing a brush up on coding

**Thoughts:** Today I'm starting 100 days of code to build a better habit of coding. I started doing the p1xt 3.0 Job Ready guide as I had already done some of the 2.0 guide. I was doing Tier 1 for the basics and refresher to get into it, but that may be too basic.

**Link to work:** Not available yet as I am going to figure out surge.sh hosting tomorrow!
